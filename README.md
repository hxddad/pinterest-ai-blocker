# ðŸ“¸ BlurAI â€” Blur AI-Generated Images on Pinterest

BlurAI is a lightweight Google Chrome extension that automatically **detects and blurs AI-generated images** on your Pinterest feed using the powerful [Sightengine API](https://sightengine.com/).

**Idea Inspired by:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR73xDbB24c&t=19s

## How It Works
1. The extension scans all visible images on your Pinterest feed.
2. Each image is sent to the [Sightengine](https://sightengine.com/) API for analysis.
3. If the image is classified as **AI-generated** (deepfake, synthetic, GAN, etc.), it is blurred automatically.
4. New images loaded as you scroll are also processed in real-time.
